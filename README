To run the example, follow these steps:

1) Make sure you have installed SimGrid (3.9 recommended).
   (http://simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/)

2) Inside MRSG's root and examples directories, edit the Makefiles and change
   the INSTALL_PATH variable to match your SimGrid installation path
   (e.g. /usr).

3) Compile MRSG with 'make' in the command line, and then do the same for the
   example.

4) Copy the g5k.xml platform from SimGrid's examples into MRSG's examples folder.

5) Execute the example (./hello.bin).
